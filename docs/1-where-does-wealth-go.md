# Where does wealth go?

The first step to be able to accumulate wealth is to know where your money is going. If you're employed, you will have an expected stable in stream of wealth, nevertheless generally, we are unaware of where does it go.

We can classify movements in our wealth in 2 types of transactions:

* Income: Money that comes into our wealth.
* Expenses: Money that goes out of our wealth.

This is the first level of classification. Nevertheless, this is too generic, specially when we speak about expenses, to know where is the money going. For this, let's drill down in the expenses.

| Name | description | type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| market | What we need on our day-to-day like food | necessary |
| Living | Payments for mortgage or rent | necessary |
| leisure | Things that help us disconnect | avoidable |
| debt | Things we have bought that we were unable to afford | avoidable |

You can create a spreadsheet and track this. You can see where your money is going. When we classify in types `necessary` and `avoidable` does not mean we should not spend in avoidable expenses always. But we should be aware of this not becoming a sink for money.
